### Instructions

You are summarizing **closed GitHub issues**, into **concise, user-facing changelog entries** for a specific category `${category_title}`. 
The provided issues have been pre-filtered to include only those that contain **at least one of these labels**: `${category_labels}` 


### Requirements:
- Group issues if they affect the same feature or address the same user-facing behavior.
- Avoid repetition between entry items.
- Do not mention ticket or issue numbers in the summary **except** as specified in the template defined by `Format`.
- Keep the language clear and non-technical, suitable for end users or product managers.
- Prefer actionable language (e.g. “Added,” “Fixed,” “Improved”).
- Avoid developer-centric language (e.g., “refactored,” “API call,” “backend”), internal code terms, or references to libraries or tools.
- Return only the list of bullet points formatted as changelog entries. Do not add extra commentary or explanation.
- For test-related issues, include a short note (max 50 chars). Do not list individual tests or implementation details


### Format:
Use this template for each changelog entry:

`${change_template}`


#### Example:
- Added dark mode support to the dashboard and settings (#123)
- Fixed issue with login failing due to multi sessions (#123, #789)
