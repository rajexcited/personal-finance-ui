# Demo Site

We are deploying demo site to github pages for user / tester to try features before deploying to production.

> The demo site deployment could be in between dev and prod or parallel to prod.  
> So all enhancements available to demo site isn't necessary to be in Prod

When there are new enhancements working functionally locally with demo setup. and all changes are in master branch.

commit to master branch with message `deploy gh demo`, this will start deployment of demo site to github pages.
