To run the end-to-end tests using Cypress, you need to install Cypress and any necessary dependencies. Here are the steps:

1. Install Cypress:

   ```bash
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```

2. If you are using TypeScript, you may also need to install the Cypress types:

   ```bash
   npm install @types/cypress --save-dev
   ```

3. Add a script to your `package.json` to open Cypress:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "cypress:open": "cypress open",
     "cypress:run": "cypress run"
   }
   ```

4. Run Cypress:
   ```bash
   npm run cypress:open
   ```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can run your end-to-end tests.

For the integration tests using React Testing Library, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. Install React Testing Library and Jest:

   ```bash
   npm install @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jest --save-dev
   ```

2. Add a script to your `package.json` to run the tests:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "test": "jest"
   }
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

These steps will set up the necessary environment to run both your integration and end-to-end tests.
