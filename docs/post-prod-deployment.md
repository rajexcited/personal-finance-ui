The task you're referring to is commonly known as **Post-Deployment Verification** or **Post-Deployment Testing**. This step ensures that the deployment was successful, the application is functioning as expected, and users can browse the UI without issues. Here are more details, including additional tasks that may be involved in the process, and things you can automate:

### 1. **Post-Deployment Verification / Testing**

- **Definition**: This is the process of verifying that the deployed code works correctly in the production environment and that the application is accessible and functional. You check if the UI is loading properly, all links and buttons are functional, and the overall user experience is as expected.
- **Alternative Terms**:
  - **Smoke Testing**: A quick check to ensure that the application is stable enough for further testing or for end-users to interact with.
  - **Sanity Testing**: Ensuring that key functionalities work after deployment (e.g., logging in, browsing, etc.).
  - **Health Check**: A monitoring check to ensure that the application and server are responding and working fine.

### 2. **Other Tasks to Perform Post-Deployment**

After deployment, you may need to perform the following tasks to ensure everything is working correctly:

- **Check Logs**: Review application, server, and error logs for any issues or warnings that might indicate problems with the deployment.
- **Monitor Performance**: Use performance monitoring tools to ensure the application is running at an optimal speed (e.g., response times, CPU/memory usage).
- **Check Critical User Flows**: Manually test key features such as user login, registration, payment processing, or data submission forms to ensure they function correctly.
- **Browser Compatibility Testing**: Verify that the UI is browsable on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Test API Endpoints**: If your app relies on APIs, verify that all API calls are functioning properly.
- **Check for Errors or Alerts**: Ensure there are no new errors showing up on your production environment, such as JavaScript errors or broken links.
- **Backup/Recovery Validation**: If your system includes data or database backups, ensure that they are working and can be restored in case of an issue.

### 3. **Automation Opportunities**

Many of these tasks can be automated, especially in continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Here are areas you can automate:

- **Automated Smoke Testing**: Set up automated scripts to check if the basic functionality (like loading the homepage, logging in, etc.) works after deployment. You can use tools like **Selenium**, **Cypress**, or **Playwright** for UI testing.
- **Automated Browser Testing**: Tools like **BrowserStack** or **Sauce Labs** can run automated cross-browser and cross-device testing to ensure that your UI is functional across different environments.
- **API Testing**: Use tools like **Postman**, **Newman** (Postman’s command-line tool), or **RestAssured** to automate the testing of your API endpoints to ensure they return the expected results.
- **Error Monitoring**: Implement tools like **Sentry**, **Rollbar**, or **New Relic** to automatically capture and report errors or exceptions that occur in production.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use automated performance monitoring tools like **Google Lighthouse**, **Pingdom**, or **Datadog** to run regular checks on response times and overall system performance.
- **Load Testing**: Use tools like **JMeter** or **Gatling** to simulate user traffic and verify how your application behaves under load.
- **Health Checks**: Automate health checks for the application to monitor server uptime, API responses, and the general health of the infrastructure. Tools like **UptimeRobot**, **Pingdom**, or custom scripts using **curl** commands can be set up for these checks.

### 4. **Other Best Practices**

- **Deploy in Stages**: If possible, use a canary release or blue-green deployment strategy. This minimizes risk by deploying to a small set of users first and gradually expanding it.
- **Alerting**: Set up automated alerts (using tools like **PagerDuty** or **Slack notifications**) to inform your team if any critical issues are detected post-deployment.
- **Rollback Plan**: Ensure you have an automated rollback strategy in place, in case you need to revert the deployment quickly. Many CI/CD tools like **GitLab CI**, **Jenkins**, and **CircleCI** support automated rollback mechanisms.

### Summary

- The term you’re looking for is **Post-Deployment Verification** or **Smoke Testing**.
- Other tasks to perform after deployment include log checking, performance monitoring, verifying critical flows, and testing API and browser compatibility.
- Many tasks can be automated, such as smoke testing, cross-browser testing, API testing, error monitoring, performance monitoring, and health checks, using various testing and monitoring tools.

Automating these tasks can help ensure that deployments are smooth, reliable, and faster to verify, reducing the risk of human error and ensuring quicker response times to any issues that arise.
